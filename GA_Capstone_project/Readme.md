# What Should I Watch Next?
A movie recommendation engine using the movielens 20M dataset that addresses choice fatigue by personalizing the user experience to build customer loyalty and retention. The engine built is a hybrid engine combining content and collaborative-based filtering in Python using  Scikit-Learn and Surprise packages on AWS. Evaluation accuracy predicted user ratings within .7 stars in a 5-star rating scheme. The model is set up for post-deployment evaluation and facilitation for cross-selling of products. The Dataset has 130,000+ Users, 10,000+ Movies, and 20,000,000 Ratings. Each movie has a set of 1,000 Attributes also rated on a scale of 0-5.
